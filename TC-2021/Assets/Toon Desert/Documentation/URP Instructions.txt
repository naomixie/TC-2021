Added URP compatibility from 2019.4 and later.

When importing the pack in a URP project, open the "URP_Install_Toon Desert" file from the project hierarchy.
After the installation, if necessary, right-click the Models and Prefabs folders and select "Reimport", in case the asset preview icons show pink.
