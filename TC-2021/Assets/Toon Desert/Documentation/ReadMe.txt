Thank you for purchasing Toon Desert!

If you like it, pleaase review it :)

	Version 1.0:

The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.
Objects are easy to place in the scene if you use vertex snapping, or if you use a grid 
placement system.

Terrain building is pretty easy, ground tiles and road assets use a 12x12 grid system and other assets use either multiples or divisors of that value.

All models come with centered pivot points at the base or, in case of fence modules, at the edge, for easy building.

The naming convention uses the “.L” and “.R” suffixes 
for wheels and objects that may be animated on the left-hand side and right-hand side respectively.
Example: the wheel on the front right of a vehicle uses the suffix "_Wheel_F.R”

The characters are configured for humanoid animation type, so you can easily add your own compatible animations.

There are numerous customizing options for characters, some variants have been included in the prefab folder.

Vehicles come in two variants where applicable. The "_Mobile" versions have no interiors and no transparent windows.

Some of the objects have moving parts, such as animatable lights, animatable doors, etc.
It's easy to edit their position and rotation, by selecting them from the objects’ hierarchy.

In addition to the graphic assets, there have been added 2 skyboxes (for day and night light settings) and 2 post processing profiles.
